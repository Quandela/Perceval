   Perceval, the Story of the Grail – Chrétien de Troyes (circa 1180)

Welcome to the Perceval documentation!
======================================

Through a simple object-oriented Python API, Perceval provides tools for composing photonic circuits from linear optical components like beamsplitters and phase shifters,
defining single-photon sources, manipulating Fock states, and running simulations.

Perceval can be used to reproduce published experimental works or to
experiment directly with a new generation of quantum algorithms.

It aims to be a companion tool for developing photonic circuits –
for simulating and optimising their design,
modelling both the ideal and realistic behaviours, and proposing a normalised
interface to control them through the concept of *backends*.

Perceval is conceived as an object-oriented modular Python framework orgainised around the following elements:

* Tools to :ref:`build linear optical circuits <Circuits>` from a collection of pre-defined :ref:`components <Components>`
* Powerful :ref:`computing backends <Computing Backends>` implemented in C++
* A variety of technical utilities to manipulate:
   - :ref:`Fock states, state vectors and state vector distributions <States>`,
   - :ref:`unitary matrices <Matrices>`,
   - :ref:`parameters <Parameters>`.

It also includes transversal tools for flexible :ref:`visualization <Visualization>` of the circuits and results which are compatible
with notebooks or local development environments.

Perceval has been developed as a complete toolkit for physicists and computer scientists, and for students, researchers,
and practitioners of quantum computing.
