    "# Boson Bunching\n",
    "\n",
    "A prominent example of boson bunching is the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, where the bunching of two photons arises from a destructive quantum interference between the trajectories where they both either cross a beam splitter or are reflected. This effect takes its roots in the indistinguishability of identical photons. You can read more about it [[1]](#references).\n",
    "More generally one can send in $n$ photons into an optical interferometer via $m$ modes and one then measures in which modes the photons are ending up.\n",
    "For the example discussed here there are 7 photons sent into 7 modes and we are interested in the probability that all 7 photons end up in the first two modes. The interferometer is described by an unitary matrix and the incoming photons can be fully indistinguishable, fully distinguishable or partially distinguishable.\n",
