    "This notebook is about implementing Gedik's Algorithm using Perceval. The specific algorithm is considered a Quantum Algorithm which tries to solve a problem by taking advantage of the attributes of a Quantum Computer. Gedik's algorithm is used to solve a black-box problem. The main task of the algorithm is to determine whether a specific permutation is clockwise or counterclockwise. This translates as a problem of finding the parity of the permutation. In order to implement the code efficiently, we used one qudit with 4 dimensions (ququart). \n",
    "\n",
    "Gedik's algorithm provides an example of a quantum algorithm that provides a speed-up compared to its classical implementation. This happens because in the classical case at least two function evaluations are required to find the parity of the permutation. For the quantum case only one function evaluation is enough to determine the parity of the permutation."
