Run quantum algorithms
======================

Perceval provides a processor-centric syntax to run an algorithm locally or remotely, on a simulator or an actual QPU.

Build a processor
------------------

A :ref:`Processor` is a composite element aiming at simulating an actual QPU, in real world conditions.

* It holds a single photon :ref:`Source`
* It is a composition of unitary circuits and non-unitary components
* Input and output ports can be defined, with encoding semantics
* Logical post-processing can be set-up through heralded modes (ancillas) and a final post-selection function
* It contains the means of simulating the setup it describes with one of the provided :ref:`Computing Backends`

Create a local processor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a local processor, you just need to start with a :ref:`Circuit`, provide a backend name, and an optional
:ref:`Source` with the following syntax:

>>> processor = pcvl.Processor("MY_BACKEND", my_circuit, my_source)

If omitted, the source is a perfect single photon source.

The processor definition is then fine-tuned with ports (``add_port``) and herald (``add_herald``) definition as in the
following heralded CNOT gate example:

>>> import perceval as pcvl
>>> from perceval.components import BS, PERM, Port
>>> from perceval.utils import Encoding
>>> c_hcnot = (pcvl.Circuit(8, name="Heralded CNOT")
...            .add((0, 1, 2), PERM([1, 2, 0]))
...            .add((4, 5), BS.H())
...            .add((5, 6, 7), PERM([1, 2, 0]))
...            .add((3, 4), BS.H())
...            .add((2, 3), BS.H(theta=self.theta1, phi_bl=np.pi, phi_tr=np.pi/2, phi_tl=-np.pi/2))
...            .add((4, 5), BS.H(theta=self.theta1))
...            .add((3, 4), BS.H())
...            .add((5, 6, 7), PERM([2, 1, 0]))
...            .add((1, 2), PERM([1, 0]))
...            .add((2, 3), BS.H(theta=self.theta2))
...            .add((4, 5), BS.H(theta=self.theta2, phi_bl=np.pi, phi_tr=np.pi/2, phi_tl=-np.pi/2))
...            .add((5, 6), PERM([1, 0]))
...            .add((4, 5), BS.H())
...            .add((4, 5), PERM([1, 0]))
...            .add((0, 1, 2), PERM([2, 1, 0])))
>>> processor_hcnot = pcvl.Processor("SLOS", c_hcnot)
>>> processor_hcnot.add_herald(0, 0)
...                .add_herald(1, 1)
...                .add_port(2, Port(Encoding.DUAL_RAIL, 'data'))
...                .add_port(4, Port(Encoding.DUAL_RAIL, 'ctrl'))
...                .add_herald(6, 0)
...                .add_herald(7, 1)
>>> pcvl.pdisplay(processor_hcnot, recursive=True)

Processor composition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Processors can be composed with another processor. That is, for example, how the :ref:`Qiskit converter` outputs a
complex preconfigured processor from a gate-based circuit.

Remote processors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``RemoteProcessor`` class is the entry point for sending a computation on a remote platform (a simulator or a QPU).
`Quandela Cloud <https://cloud.quandela.com>`_ is a publicly available cloud service with available QPUs and simulators.
An access token on the selected service is required to connect to a remote platform (e.g an access token to Quandela
Cloud with rights is required to follow this tutorial: :ref:`Remote computing with Perceval`).

A given processor is only able to support some specific types of commands related to its hardware implementation. For
instance, a real QPU is natively able to sample output detections, but not to compute probabilities of output states
versus an input state. Hardware constraints might also enforce the coincidence counting type, or the type of detection
(threshold detection or photon number resolving).

When creating a ``RemoteProcessor``, you can query its capabilities

>>> token_qcloud = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
>>> remote_simulator = RemoteProcessor("sim:ascella", token_qcloud)
>>> print(remote_simulator.available_commands)
['probs']

This means `sim:ascella` is only able to natively answer to `probs` commands (i.e. compute the probability of all output
states given an input state).

Work with algorithms
--------------------

All algorithms take either a local or a remote processor as parameter, in order to perform a task. A ``Processor`` runs
simulations on the local computer while a ``RemoteProcessor`` turns Perceval into the client of a remote service like
Quandela Cloud, and the computation is performed on the selected platform.

However, for user experience, an algorithm has the same behavior be it run locally or remotely: every call to an
algorithm command returns a ``Job`` hiding this complexity.

>>> local_p = pcvl.Processor("CliffordClifford2017", pcvl.BS())
>>> local_p.with_input(pcvl.BasicState('|1,1>'))
>>> sampler = pcvl.algorithm.Sampler(local_p)
>>> local_job = sampler.sample_count(10000)

Here, the computation has not started yet, but it's been prepared in ``local_job`` to run locally.

>>> token_qcloud = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
>>> remote_p = pcvl.RemoteProcessor("sim:clifford", token_qcloud)
>>> remote_p.set_circuit(pcvl.BS())
>>> remote_p.with_input(pcvl.BasicState('|1,1>'))
>>> sampler = pcvl.algorithm.Sampler(remote_p)
>>> remote_job = sampler.sample_count(10000)

Here, the computation was set-up to run on `sim:clifford` platform when ``remote_job`` is executed.

Handle a Job object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Both ``LocalJob`` and ``RemoteJob`` share the same interface.

* Execute a job synchronously

>>> results = job.execute_sync(*args)  # Executes the job synchronously (blocks the execution until results are ready)
>>> results = job(*args)  # Same as above

* Execute a job asynchronously

>>> job.execute_async(*args)

This call is non-blocking, however results are not available when this line has finished executing. The job object
provides information on the progress.

>>> while not job.is_complete:  # Check if the job has finished running
...     print(job.status.progress)  # Progress is a float value between 0. and 1. representing a progress from 0 to 100%
...     time.sleep(1)
>>> if job.is_failed:  # Check if the job has failed
...     print(job.status.stop_message)  # If so, print the reason
>>> results = job.get_results()  # Retrieve the results if any

Typically, the results returned by an algorithm is a Python dictionary containing a ``'results'`` key, plus additional
data.

* A job cancelation can be requested programmatically by the user

>>> job.cancel()  # Ask for job cancelation. The actual end of the execution may take some time

When a job is canceled, it may contain partial results. To retrieve them, call :meth:`get_results()`.

* A remote job can be resumed as following:

>>> token_qcloud = "YOUR_API_KEY"  # A valid token is required
>>> remote_processor = pcvl.RemoteProcessor("any:worker", token_qcloud)
>>> job = remote_processor.resume_job("job_id")  # You can find job IDs on Quandela Cloud's website

Provided algorithms
-------------------

Algorithms provided with Perceval are available in the Python package ``perceval.algorithm``. They can be as simple as
a ``Sampler`` algorithm, as specific as ``QRNG`` (certified random number generator), which would work only on some
dedicated QPUs.

Sampler
^^^^^^^

The ``Sampler`` is the simplest algorithm provided, yet an important gateway to using processors.

All processors do not share the same capabilities. For instance, a QPU is able to sample, but not to sample output
probabilities given an input. The ``Sampler`` algorithm allows the user to call any of the three main `primitives` on any
processor:

>>> sampler = pcvl.algorithm.Sampler(processor)
>>> samples = sampler.samples(10000)  # Sampler exposes 'samples' primitive returning a list of ordered samples
>>> print(samples['results'])
[|0,1,0,1,0,0>, |0,1,0,0,1,0>, |0,2,0,0,0,0>, |0,0,0,1,0,0>, |0,1,0,1,0,0>, |0,1,0,1,0,0>, |0,1,1,0,0,0>, |0,1,0,1,0,0>, |0,1,1,0,0,0>, |0,1,0,1,0,0>, ... (size=10000)]
>>> sample_count = sampler.sample_count(10000)  # Sampler exposes 'sample_count' returning a dictionary {state: count}
>>> prob_dist = sampler.probs()  # Sampler exposes 'probs' returning a probability distribution of all possible output states

When a `primitive` is not available on a processor, a conversion occurs automatically after the computation is complete.

Analyzer
^^^^^^^^

The ``Analyzer`` algorithm aims at testing a processor, computing a probability table between input states and expected
outputs, a performance score and an error rate.
