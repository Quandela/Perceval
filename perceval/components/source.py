    r"""Definition of a source
    We build on a phenomenological model first introduced in ref. [1] where an imperfect quantum-dot based single-photon
    source is modeled by a statistical mixture of Fock states. The model developed here, first introduced in ref. [2],
    constructs the input multi-photon state using features specific to Perceval.
