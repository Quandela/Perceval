Through a simple object-oriented python API, Perceval provides tools for building a circuit with linear optics
components, defining single-photon sources and their error model, manipulating Fock states, running simulations,
reproducing published experimental papers results and experimenting a new generation of quantum algorithms.

It is interfaced with the available QPUs on https://cloud.quandela.com, so it is possible to run computations on an
actual photonic computer.

Perceval aims to be a companion tool for developing discrete-variable photonic circuits
    - while simulating their design, modeling their ideal and real-life behaviour;
    - and proposing a normalized interface to control photonic quantum computers;
    - while using powerful simulation backends to get state-of-the-art simulation;
    - and also allowing direct access to the QPUs of Quandela.
