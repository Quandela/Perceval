class NoiseModel:
    """
    The NoiseModel class contains all noise parameters which are supported by Perceval. Default value of each
    parameter means "no noise", so a NoiseModel constructed with all default parameters leads to a perfect simulation.

    :param brightness: first lens brightness of a quantum dot
    :param indistinguishability: chance two photons are indistinguishable
    :param g2: gÂ²(0) - second order intensity autocorrelation at zero time delay. This parameter is correlated with how
               often two photons are emitted by the source instead of a single one.
    :param g2_distinguishable: g2-generated photons indistinguishability
    :param transmittance: system-wide transmittance (warning, can interfere with the brightness parameter)
    :param phase_imprecision: maximum precision of the phase shifters (0 means infinite precision)
    :param phase_error: maximum random noise on the phase shifters (in radian)
